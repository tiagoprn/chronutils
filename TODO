- [ ] Add an option to filter records on a specific time range (e.g. --from 16/01 --to 28/02)
- [ ] Create a Dockerfile with an alpine base, and apply 'docker-slim' container to reduce the image size even more. Upload it to dockerhub. Add the proper commands to test the image locally on the Makefile.
